# Python_Portfolio

In this porfolio I plan to post small and large data projects as I learn and progress with my skills using Python! I began a passion for Python late last year and I have completed a few projects but the LAPD project was my first analytical project that I have completed by myself using my own ideas and code.

## LAPD Project

* In this project, I want to evaluate the LAPD Calls for Service data of January 1st to January 22th of 2023 in the city of Los Angeles. I plan to visualize trends in crime activity by diving into location, time, and type of crimes being reported via telecom. This data set was retrieved from Data.gov with 7 Columns and over 93,000 rows. I have cleaned and visualized the data to the best of my ability at the time of posting so I hope you enjoy!


## Electric Vehicle Project

* In my second project, I wanted to evaluate the Electric Vehicle industry. I planned to visualize strengths and weaknesses in the current Electric Vehicle Makes and Model's perforamnces and popularity. This data set was retrieved from Data.gov containing 17 Columns and over 118,000 rows. I cleaned and visualized different plots in this project along with more detailed information based on new learnings!
