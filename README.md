# Python_Portfolio

In this porfolio I plan to post small and large data projects as I leanr and progress with my skills using Python! I began a passion for Python late last year and I have completed a few projects but the LAPD project was my first analytical project that I have completed by myself using my own ideas and code.

## LAPD Project

* In this project, I want to evaluate the LAPD Calls for Service data of January 1st to January 22th of 2023 in the city of Los Angeles. I plan to visualize trends in crime activity by diving into location, time, and type of crimes being reported via telecom. This data set was retrieved from Data.gov with 7 Columns and over 93,000 rows. I have cleaned and visualized the data to the best of my ability at the time of posting so I hope you enjoy!
